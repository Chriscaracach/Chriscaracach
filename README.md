# Hi there 👋 I'm Christian, thanks for take a look to my Github account.

 During the pandemic take advantage of the lockdown to learn as much as possible about frontend development.

 I decided to dedicate myself to developing interfaces with **React** and I tried to compensate for my lack of work experience, with projects of my own, trying to imitate a development environment.
 
 I've used many online learning platforms such as freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Hackerrank and I am also studying a degree at a university near me.
 
 ## 🚶 About me
 
 I am 32 years old, I am from Unquillo (Córdoba) and I live with my wife and daughter. I'm currently working as a Frontend Web Developer in a company called VelaONE from USA. 
 
 I love being a developer, it connects me with my creative side and also makes me try to be better at team work. Please feel free of contact me if you think that you have some interesting position, I'm always open to new challenges.
