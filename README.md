# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christian, thanks for take a look to my Github account.

 During the pandemic take advantage of the lockdown to learn as much as possible about frontend development.

 I decided to dedicate myself to developing interfaces with **React** and I tried to compensate for my lack of work experience, with projects of my own, trying to imitate a development environment.
 
 I have used many online learning platforms such as freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Hackerrank and I am also studying a degree at a university near me.

### If you're interested in my profile, you can browse my Github account or my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-caracach/) account.

### I also have a portfolio of works that you can visit [HERE](https://portfolioccaracach.web.app/)

## That's all. Thanks
