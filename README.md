# Hi there 👋 I'm Christian, thanks for take a look to my Github account.

 During the pandemic take advantage of the lockdown to learn as much as possible about frontend development.

 I decided to dedicate myself to developing interfaces with **React** and I tried to compensate for my lack of work experience, with projects of my own, trying to imitate a development environment.
 
 I've used many online learning platforms such as freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Hackerrank and I am also studying a degree at a university near me.
 
 ## 🚶 About me
 
 I am 30 years old, I am from Unquillo (Córdoba) and I live with my wife and daughter. I currently work as a music teacher, but I'm doing my best to live as a developer.
 
 As a music teacher, my work is related to **creativity**, **analysis** and **teamwork**. And above all, **adaptation to changes**. Those are skills I want to use heavily in my new life as a developer.
